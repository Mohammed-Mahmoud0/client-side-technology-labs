Inheritance in JavaScript is a mechanism where one object can access the properties and methods of another object. 

JavaScript supports inheritance primarily through prototypes and class syntax.

In JavaScript, every object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript checks the object itself first. If it doesn’t find it, it looks at the object’s prototype, and so on, up the prototype chain.
(that covered in today lec.) ---> thank you Eng. Omar for clarification 

			-----------------------------------
in ES6 ---> js introduced the class syntax (finally we see extend keyword).
class inheritance more logical and like another programming languages we use extend keyword
the child can inherit from parent its methods and attrib. with extend keyword.
